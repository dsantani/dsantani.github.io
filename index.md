I recently completed my PhD at Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne ([EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch)) and the [Social Computing Group](http://www.idiap.ch/~gatica/research-team.html) at [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch), working with [Daniel Gatica-Perez](http://www.idiap.ch/~gatica/). My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of computer science and social science, in particular application of large-scale data mining to various social and urban contexts. Before joining Idiap, I completed my Masters at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) and Bachelors from [Manipal Institute of Technology](http://manipal.edu/mit.html).

### Research Interests
------
My doctoral research takes a multidisciplinary approach to the computational characterization of public places from the perspective of urban perception and study how young people can document and use these urban spaces, by integrating concepts from urban studies, human geography, social psychology, and computing, including mobile crowdsensing and online crowdsourcing, machine learning, and multimedia analysis. Before I began my PhD studies at EPFL, I was conducting research at the intersection of social and urban computing, where I was involved in building systems and tools, in addition to data analysis to understand cities both at the micro and macro level.
